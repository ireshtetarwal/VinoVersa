# VinoVersa ‚Äì Wine Variety Prediction Model

A machine learning-based application that predicts wine varieties from review data. Built using Python and scikit-learn with a lightweight API layer for predictions.

## üç∑ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Flask (API)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## üîç Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed wine review dataset
- Extracted top 5 actionable insights through exploratory data analysis
- Built a predictive model using classification algorithms
- Deployed prediction model via Flask API with input/output endpoints

## üß† ML Approach
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding
- Feature engineering: selecting relevant attributes
- Model used: (e.g., Logistic Regression / Random Forest / SVM)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Confusion Matrix

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Flask API:

python app.py


4. Use Postman or browser to hit the prediction endpoint:

http://localhost:5000/predict
